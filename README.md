# ECG (Electrocardiogramm) via Raspberry Pi


This work origins from a bachelor thesis in physics and teaching at the University Salzburg, Austria.
The repository provides the necessary information to set up an ecg measurement with a raspberry pi.
Additionally, the full thesis with detailed instructions as well as educational resources (only in german) is available on [Research Gate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320133975_Elektrokardiogramm_mit_dem_Raspberry_Pi)



**Note**
This self-made ecg is intended for educational purpose and is therefore not suited for medical treatment.
